# TAMU-Cisco-Academy-Labs
This repository house all of the monthly labs I have developed for the Cisco Academy at Texas A&M. These labs are geared towards beginners in the field, looking for a place to start but challenge themselves.

The PDF file will walk you through all the configurations necessary to bring the network online, as well as the rationale behind the configurations.

All configurations were built using Cisco's Packet Tracer so equipment variety was limited. However, this lab has been tested on physical Cisco equipment and properly functions. 
Please NOTE: if you are replicating this on physical equipment, check your interface names (e.g. fa0/1, g0/1, etc.) before copy and pasting the commands in the core layer configuration files.
